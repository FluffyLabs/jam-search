 * The fjall backend is opt-in so its performance can be compared against LMDB
 * before committing to it. fjall opens its keyspace asynchronously, hence the
 * async `new`.
 *
 * Like `InMemWorkerConfig`, the blocks and leaf sets are shared across the
 * open/close/reopen dance that genesis init performs, so `openDatabase`
 * returns the same instances and a no-op close. The values store is opened once
 * here and closed by `HybridSerializedStates.close()` at importer teardown.
 *
 * In-process only: it holds shared mutable state (the in-memory leaf
 * dictionary) and so is not thread-transferable. The fuzz target runs the
 * importer in-process via `createImporter`, not in a spawned worker.
